# Drowsiness Detection using Computer Vision and CNN

## Code Overview
This code utilizes computer vision techniques along with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect drowsiness in a person's eyes via a webcam feed. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

### Imports and Setup
- `cv2`: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
- `os`: Operating system module for handling file paths.
- `keras`: Deep learning library for creating and using neural networks.
- `numpy`: Library for numerical computations.
- `pygame.mixer`: Used for playing an alarm sound.
- Initialization of sound and loading of pre-trained models and cascades (XML files used for object detection).

### Initialization
- Loading Haar cascades for face, left eye, and right eye detection.
- Loading a pre-trained CNN model (`cnncat2.h5`) to predict eye states.

### Video Capture and Processing Loop
- Starts an infinite loop to capture video frames from the webcam.
- Converts captured frames to grayscale for easier processing.
- Detects faces and eyes in the frame using the loaded Haar cascades.

### Eye State Prediction
- Iterates through detected eyes, processes them, and feeds them into the CNN model to predict open or closed states.
- The model predicts each eye's state separately, providing a probability score.

### Scoring System
- Maintains a score based on eye state predictions, reflecting the person's alertness level.
- Increments or decrements the score based on eye state predictions.

### Alerting Mechanism
- Triggers an alarm sound and draws a red bounding box around the frame if the cumulative score surpasses a threshold (15) indicating potential drowsiness.

### Display and Exit
- Real-time display of video frames annotated with eye states and score.
- Pressing 'q' terminates the loop, releasing the video capture and closing windows.

## Explanation
- The code continuously analyzes webcam frames, detecting faces and eyes.
- It employs a CNN model to predict eye states, determining a drowsiness score.
- If the score exceeds a threshold, an alarm triggers to alert potential drowsiness.
